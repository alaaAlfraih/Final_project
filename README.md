# Final_project

Description:

The web allows people to write their views about the place they visited, what they liked or disliked, what should be considered when visiting, and many other things.  
Users can leave detailed comments about the place (name, image , etc.). It will also be displayed to the public at the time the user wrote it, so they can tell if it is an old or new view .  
The view will be received by managers, who will be responsible for determining whether the view refers to a new place before displaying it to user s.Otherwise, they will ignore it because it contains bad words or because someone else has already written about the place.
